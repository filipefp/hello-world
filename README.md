# hello-world
Learning all about GitHub.

I’m a Brazilian graphic designer living in London and I‘ve just completed a Postgraduate Diploma in Design for Visual Communication, graduating with distinction. I am now looking for a job placement here, and I’d love to work in a place where I can explore, learn and create innovative projects that explore tech and design.
